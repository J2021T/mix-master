  ## Description
  Mix-Master is a web application to generate random cocktails and help you find the ingredients in the store.  We know everyone has been in the spot where they have the alcohol, but no idea what kind of cocktail to make. So we created this application using an API from CocktailDB to produce a random cocktail using the type of liqour the user clicked.  Then the user is presented with the recipe and ingredients.  If the user needs to find the ingredients in the store they can click on the ingredient and find the aisle and average cost.  This is done with the Spoonacular API, which is still working out some ingredient details.  If the user really likes a recipe they can save it to their favorites section by clicking the drink name button.
